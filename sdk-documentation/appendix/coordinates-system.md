# Coordinates System

In iOS, the physical orientation and motion of the device are measured using a three-dimensional coordinate system with three axes: X, Y, and Z. These axes represent different directions:

&#x20;

X-Axis: Horizontally from left to right in the natural portrait orientation of the device.

Y-Axis: Vertically from bottom to top in the natural portrait orientation of the device.

Z-Axis: Perpendicular to the screen, pointing out from the front of the device.

&#x20;

These axes are used in sensors like the accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer to track the device's movement and orientation. Developers can use this data for various applications that respond to physical device movements. For more information, see the[ iOS Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremotion/).

## Vehicle Coordinates System

ISO 8855 is an international standard that defines a standardized vehicle coordinate system used in the automotive industry. This system has three axes:

&#x20;

X-axis: Represents the vehicle's forward direction (rear to front).

Y-axis: Represents the vehicle's lateral direction (right to left when facing forward).

Z-axis: Represents the vehicle's vertical direction (upward from the ground).

&#x20;

The system adheres to the right-handed convention, and the its origin commonly lies on the center of mass of the vehicle. The system serves as a common reference for describing vehicle orientation and motion, facilitating communication and data exchange in the automotive field.
