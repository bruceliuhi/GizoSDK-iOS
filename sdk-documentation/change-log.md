### <mark style="color:blue;">Features</mark> ✨

* Introduce GIZO Analysis, an advanced feature that enables the extraction of data from images captured by the camera, and users can obtain insightful information from images and perform data-driven calculations and analyses.
* Introduce GIZO GPS to provide instructions on enabling GPS, accessing location, speed, direction of movement (heading), and speed limit.
* Add GIZO IMU to allow developers to utilize the motion sensors of the device IMU. The IMU typically consists of the **accelerometer**, **gyroscope**, and **magnetometer**. **Linear** and **gravity** are estimated through the fusion of IMU data.
* Introduce GIZO Video, allowing control and customization of the video recording.
* Add GIZO Battery to monitor and control the battery usage of their mobile devices.
* Add GIZO Orientation, activating the gravity sensor.
